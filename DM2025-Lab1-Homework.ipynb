    "In the full dataset, we can see the overall counts of positive (1.0), neutral (0.0), and negative (-1.0). In the sample, the distribution should look similar but not identical, since it was randomly chosen. The key improvement is that we automated the ylim using .max() + 30, instead of hardcoding it. his makes the visualization adjust automatically if the dataset changes."
